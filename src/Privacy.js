            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I am an independent hobbyist developer who values your privacy. This privacy policy applies to all apps and games that I've developed and published. It outlines my commitment to protecting your data. I do not collect, store, or share any personal information about users.
            </p>

            <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
            <p>
                My apps and games do not collect, store, or process any personal information or data from users. This includes, but is not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Names</li>
                <li>Email addresses</li>
                <li>Locations</li>
                <li>Device data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                My apps do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. I am committed to ensuring a safe and private experience for all users, especially children.
            </p>

            <h2>No Internet Connectivity</h2>
            <p>
                My apps do not require or use an internet connection. All functionality is contained within the app itself, ensuring your data remains private.
            </p>

            <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                I comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable regulations. Since my apps do not collect any personal information, they are safe for children to use.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
